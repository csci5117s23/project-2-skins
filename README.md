### If the user has not chosen an outfit for the specified day yet, it will look like this and give the user the option to choose a fit. Clicking on the Month/day/year area will popup a little calender and they can also change the day that way as well.

### On the calender there are tiny colored marks on certain days which imply that the user has chosen a fit for that day. Green implies user has chosen a full outfit, yellow implies the user has started to choose a fit, but has not completed it yet.

### The user can also access the calender from the calender icon on the bottom and it has the same features as before. Clicking on a day will bring it to the same page as above. (Home page, but with user specified day)

### From home page user clicked on choose fit and it comes here. On this page you can choose a fit for the specified date. (First img) After the user continues they start choosing their outfit pieces. Swiping left and right to change to different category of clothes and swiping down to view more stuff from the category. (second img)

### If user chooses none its implying they haven't decided yet or dont need that category of clothing. The finished outfit button is on all the pages (when swiping left and right) and is to be clicked when they have finished choosing their whole fit. (Can always add/edit fit later in "closet"(hanger icon))
